# CljSketch

CljSketch is a 2D geometry sketchpad program written in ClojureScript.

The idea is that you construct geometric objects which are defined in
terms of other geometric objects, and as you move objects around, all their
dependent objects update accordingly.

For example, if you draw two points, then select them and construct the
line through them, then drag one of the points, the constructed line will move
with it.

At the moment only the following basics are implemented:

  * draw points
  * select two points and construct
    * the line through them, or
    * the segment connecting them
  * select one point and one line and construct
    * the line through the point that is parallel to the selected line
    * the line through the point that is perpendicular to the selected line

## Running CljSketch

To run CljSketch, it's online at
